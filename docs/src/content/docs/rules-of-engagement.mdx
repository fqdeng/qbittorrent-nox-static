‚≠ê The rules of engagement are:

<Steps>

1. ### Use Docker

    - Docker is the recommended method to build using the script.
    - This will avoid many potential issues and conflicts with the host system, especially with Qt.

2. ### Use Alpine

    - It is the main supported system and Debian is testing and fallback.
    - You do not need to build on an older host to use these binaries there.

3. ### Privileges

    - `sudo` - `root`  are not required to run the script.
    - They are required to install the core dependencies if they are missing

4. ### Additional flags and switches

    - can add dependencies on demand that will need to be installed.
    - like `-c` for cmake and `-cd` for cache dependencies.
    - the script will require you to install these on demand.
    - Using `.qbt_env` or setting variables before running the script will do this automatically.

5. ### Passing no arguments

        :::tip
        `qbt-nox-static.bash` is the recommended build script
        :::

    - `qbt-nox-static.bash` - will make no changes and instead provide information on what you need to do.
    - `qbt-nox-static.bash` - will automatically install the required dependencies and configure the build environment.

6. ### Nothing is built until...

    - you provide the `all` or a specific module name as a positional parameter to the script.
    - applies to both `qbt-nox-static.bash` and `qbt-nox-static.bash`

7. ### Use the help.

    - Use `bash ~/qbt-nox-static.bash -h` to see the help.
    - applies to both `qbt-nox-static.bash` and `qbt-nox-static.bash`

8. ### fork the repo

    - build on Github using Github Actions to create your own custom releases.
    - The easiest way to get custom builds for your needs.
